%1. Begin with a restatement of your research question, followed by a statement about whether or not, and how much, your findings "answer" the question.  These should be the first two pieces of information the reader encounters.
- ci sono delle mutazioni deleterie nel DNA mitocondriale o nei geni espressi nel mitocondrio?

Do the analysis of the mtDNA sequences and the nuclear genes (involved in mitochondrial processes) of embryos from pregnancy loss informs on genes putatively causative of diseases?
%1a breve ricapitolazione dei risultati 
 With this work I demonstrated that it is possible to identify variants in mitochondrial DNA to cause diseases using high-coverage whole-genome sequence data.
 I analyzed the mtDNA sequences of the 10 embryos to discover 276 unique variable sites in all samples. Per each sample, the number of variable sites vary between 22 and 103. Using a filtering procedure  based on genomic annotations I identified 4 variants that are likely to be deleterious,These variants are found in the \textit {MT-ND2}, \textit{MT-ATP6} and \textit{MT-ND6} genes. 
Pathogenic variants of the mitochondrial gene \textit{MT-ND2} are known to cause mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome, as are variants of \textit{MT-ATP6} and \textit{MT-ND6}. 



%2. Relate your findings to the issues you raised in the introduction. Note similarities, differences, common or different trends.  Show how your study either corraborates, extends, refines, or conflicts with previous findings.

- rispetto  a quanto detto nel paragrafo dell'introduzione mt DNA e diseases (e sopratutto in miscarriages) che cosa aagiungi/confermi/discrediti 

%3. If you have unexpected findings, try to interpret them in terms of method, interpretation, even a restructured hypothesis; in extreme cases, you may have to rewrite your introduction. Be honest about the limitations of your study.


%4. State the major conclusions from your study and present the theoretical and practical implications of your study.




%5. Discuss the implications of your study for future research and be specific about the next logical steps for future researchers.
